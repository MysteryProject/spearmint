# Known issues

On Windows the keypad 5 key doesn't work without numlock enabled and on macOS 10.6+ the client only executes mouse wheel control binds if wheel is turned multiple notches (SDL 2.0.8 bugs).


# How to play

To play Spearmint Quake 3, copy Quake 3's baseq3/pak[0-8].pk3 into the local baseq3 directory.
To play the Team Arena expansion, copy Quake 3 Team Arena's missionpack/pak[0-3].pk3 into the local missionpack directory.

If you don't own Quake 3 or Team Arena, they can be purchased on Steam or GOG.com. Team Arena is not required to play Quake 3.

  * https://www.gog.com/game/quake_iii_gold

If you're missing some of the Quake 3 or Team Arena patch pk3s (pak1 or higher), they are available at http://ioquake3.org/extras/patch-data/

After copying the data, run spearmint_x86 or if using a 64-bit OS run spearmint_x86_64. On macOS, run the universal App Bundle.


# Additional games

To use OpenArena data with Spearmint Quake 3 game logic, copy OpenArena 0.8.8's baseoa/*.pk3 into the local baseoa directory.
To use The Mission Pack expansion data, copy OpenArena 0.8.8's missionpack/*.pk3 into the local missionpackoa directory (not missionpack!).
Note that none of the additional OpenArena game modes are available. Debian's repackaged OpenArena data files have a checksum mismatch warning.

To play the Quake 3 demo, copy demoq3/pak0.pk3 into the local demoq3 directory.

To play the Team Arena demo, copy tademo/pak0.pk3 into the local tademo directory.

If you only install one game, it will automatically load by default.

The default game selection order is baseq3, baseoa, demoq3, tademo.
You can choose which game is loaded from the command line using "spearmint_x86.exe +set fs_game baseoa"
or by changing the load priority by editing spearmint-gamelist.txt.


# Splitscreen in Quake 3 / OpenArena

When starting a server or skirmish, the first four player slots can be set to "Human" to enable the corresponding splitscreen player.

Players can be added and removed while in-game. Open the in-game menu using Escape, click Local Players, then click “Player #” to add or remove the player.

Splitscreen is not available in Single Player mode.


# Splitscreen in Team Arena / The Mission Pack

Team Arena does not have splitscreen support in the menu.

To add a splitscreen player, start or join a server then open the console using "~" or shift+escape.
Type "2dropin" to add second player and "2dropout" to remove second player. "3dropin", "4dropin" etc for players 3 and 4.
Type "2" or "+2" and then press the tab key to see commands and console variables for splitscreen player 2.

It's not possible to configure the splitscreen controls in the Team Arena menu.
It's probably easiest to configure the controls in Quake 3 and then copy the binds from settings/baseq3/config.cfg to settings/missionpack/config.cfg.


# Game controllers

To enable a controller in Quake 3 / OpenArena, go to Setup -> Controls -> Player # -> Joy -> Select Joystick.
The controller must be connected before starting Spearmint.

Team Arena / The Mission Pack menu does not support selecting a controller.

Spearmint supports various controller mappings by default, but requires binding them in the controls menu (like keyboard keys).
If a controller's buttons cannot be bound in controls menu, it means that the controller mapping must be manually configured.
See gamepad-controls.txt for details.

gamecontrollerdb.txt is a read-only file with additional controller mappings.
For details/updates, see https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB


# Where do the saved files go?

All files are saved into the "settings" directory if it exists. It has been included so that this is a portable installation.

If the "settings" directory is deleted then a system path will be used.

  * Windows: %APPDATA%\Spearmint\
  * GNU/Linux: /home/username/.local/share/spearmint/
  * macOS: /Users/username/Library/Application Support/Spearmint/


# How to run a server

You can start a server in the menu using the Spearmint client. There are no notable issues compared to running a
dedicated server other than if the host changes their video settings the game will stall for a moment.

To run a dedicated server, open a terminal or command prompt and change to the directory containing Spearmint
and run "spearmint-server_x86.exe +set net_port 27960 +set sv_public 1 +set sv_pure 0 +set fs_game baseq3 +map q3dm17".
For Internet servers, forward port 27960 (UDP) in your router to the IP of the computer running the Spearmint server.

  * net_port defines the UDP-port used for connections to the server (default: 27960)
  * sv_public 0 is LAN, 1 is Internet (default: 0)
  * sv_pure 0 allows clients to use pk3-files not present on the server (default: 1)
  * fs_game should be the game/mod you want to play (default: first installed game found in mint-gamelist.txt or baseq3)
  * You must load a level using the map command before players can connect.


# Fonts

Spearmint supports using TrueType (.ttf, .ttc), OpenType (.otf, .otc), and Windows (.fon) fonts are all text drawing.
The fonts are rendered to the game window resolution for high quality text at any resolution.

By default Quake 3 and Team Arena's main fonts Arial Bold and Impact are replaced with Liberation Sans Bold (similar to Arial Bold).
By default the monospaced Arial Bold console text uses Liberation Mono Regular.
The fonts license/attribution is included in LIBERATION_LICENSE.txt.

You can use different fonts by copying them into the top-level fonts directory and setting the following console variables to "fonts/example.ttf".
To use the original game's fonts, set the console variables to "".
Custom fonts are allowed when connected to pure multiplayer servers.

Common Fonts
  * cg_consoleFont -- Recommend using a monospaced font for the console -- default: "fonts/LiberationMono-Regular.ttf"
  * cg_consoleFontSize -- Size of the console font (default: 8)
  * cg_hudFont -- Used for both Q3 (Arial Bold) and Team Arena (Impact) HUD text -- default: "fonts/LiberationSans-Bold.ttf"
  * cg_hudFontBorder -- Black outline border width for HUD font (default: 2)
  * cg_numberFont -- Used for Q3 status bar numbers and score plums (similar to Impact Wide) -- default: ""
  * cg_numberFontBorder -- Black outline border width for number font (default: 0)

Quake 3 Fonts
  * ui_menuFont -- Small text (Arial Bold) -- default: "fonts/LiberationSans-Bold.ttf"
  * ui_menuFontProp -- Large 'proportional width' text (similar to Impact Wide) -- default: ""
    * The original Q3 prop font has a glow outline effect that isn't available when using a replacement font.
  * ui_menuFontBanner -- Menu title text with circuits -- default: ""

Team Arena Fonts
  * ui_menuFont -- Used for all menu text (Impact) -- default: "fonts/LiberationSans-Bold.ttf"
    * Recommend using Impact font. You can get it from Microsoft Windows at C:\Windows\Fonts\Impact.ttf.

Additional font related console variables
  * r_fontBorderWidth <pixels> -- Minimum text black border width in pixels for better visibility. Affects all ttf, otf, etc fonts.
  * r_saveFontData 1 -- Save the rendered fonts to "settings/<gamedir>/fonts/" directory. Note that they are not compatible with Vanilla Team Arena.
  * cg_forceBitmapFonts 1 -- When enabled, original game fonts are used instead of ttf, otf, etc.
    * However, it also prevents loading Team Arena's default pre-rendered ttf fonts resulting in Team Arena using Q3's Arial Bold font.


# Colorize Crosshair based on Health

Spearmint Quake 3 includes fixed crosshair shaders to support colorizing crosshair with health value.
Set the cg_crosshairHealth console variable to 1 to enable it.


# Renderer

Spearmint includes two renderers, opengl1 and opengl2. The default is opengl1.

The opengl2 renderer uses newer OpenGL features (OpenGL 2+).
It's mostly on-par with opengl1, but may have some issues. There are various new features though.
See opengl2-readme.txt for details.

Open the in-game console by pressing "~" (the key left of 1 on US QWERTY layout) or shift+escape.
Type "com_renderer opengl2; vid_restart" and press enter. Switch back using
"com_renderer opengl1; vid_restart".


# What version of SDL is included?

Windows and GNU/Linux releases include SDL 2.0.8.
macOS x86/x86_64 uses SDL 2.0.8.
macOS PPC uses SDL 2.0.1.
